IMPORTANT DATES
 
Abstract submission:        July 15, 2015 (extended)

DIFTS (Design and Implementation of Formal Tools and Systems) workshop 
emphasizes insightful experiences in formal tools and systems design. 
The workshop provides an opportunity for discussing engineering aspects and 
various design decisions required to put formal tools and systems into 
practical use. In the past, we have invited speakers who have shared their 
deep insights and discussed the practices followed in the Industry towards 
adopting formal methods. It provides a forum for sharing challenges and 
solutions that are original with ground breaking results.

The DIFTS workshop is co-located with FMCAD 2015 and SAT 2015. The regular 
talks of DIFTS workshop will be on September 26, 2015.  The full-day 
tutorial (joint with FMCAD 2015, SAT 2015, and MEMOCODE 2015) will be 
on September 27, 2015.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

DIFTS takes a broad view of the formal tools/systems area, and solicits 
contributions from domains including, but not restricted to, decision 
procedures, verification, testing, validation, diagnosis, debugging, and 
synthesis. This workshop encourages and appreciates system development 
activities, and facilitates transparency in the experimentation. It will also 
serve as a platform to discuss open problems and future challenges in 
practicing formal methods.


INVITED SPEAKERS

Flemming Andersen, Intel, USA
Shobha Vasudevan, UIUC, USA

 
SUBMISSION
 
The workshop specifically solicits contributions with substantial engineering 
details that often do not get published but have significant practical impact.

Papers in the following two categories are solicited: (a) system category 
(10 pages, double column, 11pt), and (b) tool category (8 pages, double 
column, 11pt).

In the system category, we invite papers that have original ideas accompanied 
with novel integration techniques, adequate design/implementation details, 
important design choices made and explored, and good experimental results.

In the tool category, we invite papers that focus primarily on the engineering 
aspects of some known/popular algorithm, with significant emphasis on the 
design/implementation details, and various design choices made to advance 
current state-of-the-art approaches.

The page limit for submissions in the system category is 10 pages in double 
column format and for submissions in the tool category is 8 pages in double 
column format.

Submission of papers should be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair.

 
EVALUATION
 
To keep maintain uniformity and fairness in the reviewing process, the program
committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission based on
the following guidelines: the paper should provide enough details for others to
reproduce the results; and should solve a clearly-stated problem that is
significant and has wide interest; and the paper should provide enough
motivation for the design choices made. Overall, the paper should also clearly
identify what the main contributions of the work are.

PUBLICATION
 
All accepted contributions will be included in informal proceedings.
High quality submissions will be considered for a special issue
of journals such as  FMSD (Formal Methods in System Design) or
IEEE TC (Transactions on Computers).
