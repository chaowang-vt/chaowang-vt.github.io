<h3>
Workshop Scope</h3>

<p>
DIFTS (Design and Implementation of Formal Tools and Systems) workshop
emphasizes insightful experiences in formal tools and systems design.
The workshop provides an opportunity for discussing engineering aspects and various design decisions
required to put formal tools and systems into practical use. In the past,
we have invited speakers who have shared their deep insights
and discussed the practices followed in the Industry towards adopting formal methods.
It provides a forum for sharing challenges and solutions that are original with ground breaking results.

<p>
The DIFTS workshop is co-located with 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/hunt/FMCAD/FMCAD15/index.shtml">FMCAD 2015</a>,
<a href="http://memocode.irisa.fr/2015/">MEMOCODE 2015</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/sat15/">SAT 2015</a>.
The regular talks of DIFTS workshop will be on September 26, 2015.  
The full-day tutorial (joint with FMCAD and SAT) will be on September 27, 2015.


<p>
<h3>
Topics of Interest</h3>

<p>
DIFTS takes a broad view of the formal tools/systems area, and solicits
contributions from domains including, but not restricted to, decision
procedures, verification, testing, validation, diagnosis, debugging, and
synthesis.

This workshop encourages and appreciates system development activities, and
facilitates transparency in the experimentation.  It will also serve as a
platform to discuss open problems and future challenges in practicing formal
methods.

From Highly Efficient Formal Verification in Selected Areas to Success in an SOC-IP World</b>

    <div>

Over the past twenty years the hardware industry gained a lot of experience with practical application of formal methods- and verification. From originally being able to formally verify only RTL components with hundreds of gates, the tools today supports millions of gates. In addition, experience indicates that a combination of functional equivalence verification techniques combined with assertion based temporal logic verification of control logic is required to efficiently handle the size, functionality, and complexity of design components today. The most successful application areas have naturally been those like arithmetic, decoders/encoders, cache coherence protocols, RAS/ECC, and other areas where solid standards such as the IEEE 754 floating point standard rigorously define what the formal specifications should be. Areas where no standards are given, keep on being a challenge for formal verification since the investment in specifications are often more or less useless when the next product is being developed. Hence, the introduction of IP-components and sub-systems with standardized interfaces- and protocols to develop SOC products enables much stronger use of formal methods- and verification if used correctly.  In this presentation we will look at different successful formal verification areas and discuss how these can be used as a model- and method for success in an SOC-IP world.

In this talk, I will present the script that stars formal methods not in the lead roles, but in character roles that are seminal to the storyline. I will narrate this success story in two parts. 

In the first part, I will talk about GoldMine, a suite of algorithms for automatic assertion generation that use a combination of machine learning and formal analysis. I will discuss our methods for assertion evaluation as an allied topic to demonstrate the goodness of the GoldMine solution. I will also outline briefly the widespread applicability of the "GoldMine principle", or the combination of formal model based analysis with data driven, statistical methods in many fields like debugging, diagnostics and data analytics. 

In the second part, I will talk about a set of analog and mixed signal validation methods that provide value and efficiency over traditional Monte Carlo simulations. These methods are based on rigorous geometric analysis combined with simulation methods from robot motion planning. I will discuss worst case behavior or "eye diagram" analysis and analog test compaction as the applications of this technology. 

I will conclude by highlighting the importance of formal methods and strategic ways to scale them in an "oscar winning" performance.

          <h1>Paper Submission</h1>
        </div>

The workshop specifically solicits contributions with substantial
engineering details that often do not get published but have
significant practical impact.
 
<p>
Papers in the following two categories are solicited: (a) system
category (10 pages, double column, 11pt), and (b) tool category (8
pages, double column, 11pt).
 
<p>
In the system category, we invite papers that have original ideas
accompanied with novel integration techniques, adequate
design/implementation details, important design choices made and
explored, and good experimental results.
 
<p>
In the tool category, we invite papers that focus primarily on the
engineering aspects of some known/popular algorithm, with significant
emphasis on the design/implementation details, and various design
choices made to advance current state-of-the-art approaches.
 
<p>
The page limit for submissions in the system category is 10 pages in
double column format and for submissions in the tool category is 8
pages in double column format.
 
<p>
<p>
Submission of papers should be made electronically in PDF format via
EasyChair
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=difts15">Submission Page</a>.

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
To keep maintain uniformity and fairness in the reviewing process, the
program committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each
submission based on the following guidelines: the paper should provide
enough details for others to reproduce the results; and should solve a
clearly-stated problem that is significant and has wide interest; and
the paper should provide enough motivation for the design choices
made. Overall, the paper should also clearly identify what the main
contributions of the work are.

          <h3>Publication</h3>

<p>
All accepted contributions will be included in informal proceedings.
High quality submissions will be considered for a special issue of
journals such as FMSD (Formal Methods in System Design) or IEEE TC
(Transactions on Computers).

Bit-blasting is the main approach for solving
word-level constraints in SAT Modulo Theories (SMT) for
bit-vector logics. However, in practice it often reaches its
limits, even if combined with sophisticated rewriting and
simplification techniques. In this paper, we extended a recently
proposed alternative based on stochastic local search
(SLS) and improve neighbor selection based on down
propagation of assignments. We further reimplemented
the previous SLS approach in our SMT solver Boolector
and confirm its effectiveness. We then added our novel
propagation-based extension and provide an extensive experimental
evaluation, which suggests that combining these
techniques with Boolector’s bit-blasting engine enables
Boolector to solve substantially more instances.

Some runtime checks can be safely removed
from code if appropriate program properties are
proved. We describe how we have applied this
idea to the ACL2 theorem prover to speed up
the application of user-defined proof procedures.
In particular, we discuss how and why we have
added a new feature to ACL2 that allows the
user to verify certain well-formedness proper-
ties of the expressions produced by user-defined
proof procedures. Of special interest are the is-
sues of extensibility (how we know that guaran-
tees proved in one theory are adequate in an-
other), formalization of the problem, and design
decisions affecting the user interface.

The predominant, root design among current
proof assistants, the LCF style, is traditionally realized
through impure, functional languages. Thus, languages
that eschew side-effects in the name of purity collectively
represent a largely untapped platform for exploring alternate
implementations of LCF-style provers. The work in
this paper details the challenges we have encountered in
the development of one such implementation, a monadic
approach to the LCF style tailored to the Haskell programming
language. The resultant proof system, HaskHOL,
is introduced and our current work with it is briefly
discussed.

Over the past twenty years the hardware industry gained a lot of experience with practical application of formal methods- and verification. From originally being able to formally verify only RTL components with hundreds of gates, the tools today supports millions of gates. In addition, experience indicates that a combination of functional equivalence verification techniques combined with assertion based temporal logic verification of control logic is required to efficiently handle the size, functionality, and complexity of design components today. The most successful application areas have naturally been those like arithmetic, decoders/encoders, cache coherence protocols, RAS/ECC, and other areas where solid standards such as the IEEE 754 floating point standard rigorously define what the formal specifications should be. Areas where no standards are given, keep on being a challenge for formal verification since the investment in specifications are often more or less useless when the next product is being developed. Hence, the introduction of IP-components and sub-systems with standardized interfaces- and protocols to develop SOC products enables much stronger use of formal methods- and verification if used correctly.  In this presentation we will look at different successful formal verification areas and discuss how these can be used as a model- and method for success in an SOC-IP world.

We describe a new method for bounded model-checking
of probabilistic automata (PAs), based on heuristic search
and integrated into the PRISM model-checker. PA models
include both probabilistic transitions and nondeterministic
choice transitions. Our search-based approach aims to address
weaknesses in statistical and dynamic-programming
approaches to checking bounded PCTL properties of probabilistic
automata. To model-check properties of PA models,
we must demonstrate that the property will be satisfied even
in the face of an adversary that optimally resolves nondeterministic
choices. We use heuristically guided AO* search
to find the optimal adversary policy and estimate the probability
of properties. We adapt techniques from Artificial
Intelligence Planning to develop a heuristic that is based
on a relaxation of the underlying probability model. This
heuristic provides critical guidance to the search algorithm:
without it, even very small models are unsolvable. We have
implemented our algorithm in the PRISM model-checker,
and show cases where it outperforms PRISM’s dynamic programming
methods. We also describe promising directions
for future work in search-based PA model-checking, notably
introducing further abstraction into the heuristic to address
memory issues.

Active learning of register automata infers
extended finite state machines (EFSMs) with registers
for storing values from a possibly infinite domain, and
transition guards that compare data parameters to registers.
In this paper, we present RALib, an extension to
the LearnLib framework for automata learning. RALib
provides an extensible implementation of active learning
of register automata, together with modules for output,
typed parameters, mixing different tests on data values,
and directly inferring models of Java classes. RALib also
provides heuristics for finding counterexamples as well as
a range of performance optimizations. Compared to other
tools for learning EFSMs, we show that RALib is superior
with respect to expressivity, features, and performance.

To find the optimal policy for large Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs), where state space explosion
makes analytic methods infeasible, we turn to statistical
methods. In this work, we apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search to learning the optimal policy for a MDP
with respect to a Probabilistic Bounded Linear Temporal
Logic property. After we have the policy, we
can proceed with statistical model checking or probability
estimation for the property against the MDP.
We have implemented this method as an extension to
the PRISM probabilistic model checker, and discuss
its results for several case studies.

In this talk, I will present the script that stars formal methods not in the lead roles, but in character roles that are seminal to the storyline. I will narrate this success story in two parts. 

In the first part, I will talk about GoldMine, a suite of algorithms for automatic assertion generation that use a combination of machine learning and formal analysis. I will discuss our methods for assertion evaluation as an allied topic to demonstrate the goodness of the GoldMine solution. I will also outline briefly the widespread applicability of the "GoldMine principle", or the combination of formal model based analysis with data driven, statistical methods in many fields like debugging, diagnostics and data analytics. 

In the second part, I will talk about a set of analog and mixed signal validation methods that provide value and efficiency over traditional Monte Carlo simulations. These methods are based on rigorous geometric analysis combined with simulation methods from robot motion planning. I will discuss worst case behavior or "eye diagram" analysis and analog test compaction as the applications of this technology. 

I will conclude by highlighting the importance of formal methods and strategic ways to scale them in an "oscar winning" performance.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine cyber aspects such as communication and computer control with physical aspects such as movement in space, which arise frequently in many safety-critical application domains, including aviation, automotive, railway, and robotics. But how can we ensure that these systems are guaranteed to meet their design goals, e.g., that an aircraft will not crash into another one?

This tutorial focuses on the most elementary CPS model: hybrid systems, which are dynamical systems with interacting discrete transitions and continuous evolutions along differential equations. It describes a compositional programming language for hybrid systems and shows how to specify and verify correctness properties of hybrid systems in differential dynamic logic. Extensions of this logic that support CPS models with more general dynamics will be surveyed briefly.

In addition to providing a strong theoretical foundation for CPS, differential dynamic logics have also been instrumental in verifying many applications, including the Airborne Collision Avoidance System ACAS X, the European Train Control System ETCS, several automotive systems, mobile robot navigation with the dynamic window algorithm, and a surgical robotic system for skull-base surgery. The approach is implemented in the theorem prover KeYmaera X.

Synthesis is the question of how to construct a correct system from a specification. In recent years, synthesis has made major steps from a theoretist’s dream towards a practical design tool. While synthesis from a language like LTL has very high complexity, synthesis can be quite practical when we are willing to compromise on the specification formalism. Similarly, we can take a pragmatic approach to synthesize small distributed systems, a problem that is in general undecidable.

Abductive inference is a form of backwards logical reasoning that infers likely hypotheses from a given conclusion. In other words, given an invalid implication of the form A => B, abduction asks the question "What formula C do we need to conjoin with the antecedent A so that (i) A & C => B is logically valid and (ii) C is consistent with A?" Abductive reasoning has found many applications in program verification and synthesis, particularly in modular program analysis, invariant generation, and automated inference of missing program expressions. This tutorial will give an overview of logical abduction and algorithms for performing abductive inference. We will also survey several use cases of abductive inference in the context of program analysis, verification, and synthesis.
