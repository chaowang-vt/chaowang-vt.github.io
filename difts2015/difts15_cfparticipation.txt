DIFTS (Design and Implementation of Formal Tools and Systems) workshop 
emphasizes insightful experiences in formal tools and systems design. 
The workshop provides an opportunity for discussing engineering aspects and 
various design decisions required to put formal tools and systems into 
practical use. In the past, we have invited speakers who have shared their 
deep insights and discussed the practices followed in the Industry towards 
adopting formal methods. It provides a forum for sharing challenges and 
solutions that are original with ground breaking results.

The regular talks of DIFTS workshop will be on September 26, 2015.  The 
full-day tutorial (joint with FMCAD 2015, SAT 2015, and MEMOCODE 2015)
