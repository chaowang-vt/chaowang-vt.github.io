Speaker Bio.:

Roderick Bloem received an MS in computer science from Leiden
University in the Netherlands (1996) and a PhD from the University of
Colorado at Boulder (2001). His thesis work, under the supervision of
Fabio Somenzi, was on formal verification using Linear Temporal Logic.

Since 2002, he has been an assistant professor at Graz University of
Technology and a full profesor since 2008. His research interests are
in formal methods for the design and verification of digital systems,
including hardware, software, and combinations such as embedded
systems. He studies applications of game theory to the automatic
synthesis of systems from their specifications, connections between
temporal logics and omega-automata, model checking, and automatic
fault localization and repair.
